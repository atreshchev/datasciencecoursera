Including caching to optimize chunks' evaluating time ()
```{r global_default_chunks_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

## Using knitr without GUI (and not evaluating the code below)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit2html("document.Rmd")
browseURL("document.html")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x
y <- rnorm(5)
y
```

Evaluating the code but hiding the results
```{r, results = "hide"}
x + y
```

## Inline text computations
```{r inline_text_computations, echo = FALSE}
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
rand <- rnorm(1)
```

The current time is: `r time`.
Random number is: `r rand`.

## Incorporating Graphics
First let's get the data
```{r simulatedata}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
```

Here is a scatterplot of the data
```{r drawdata, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 1), las = 1)
plot(x, y, main = "Simulated data")
```

## Making HTML Tables with 'xtable' package
```{r dataset}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
```

Here is a table of regression coefficients
```{r htmltable, results = "asis"}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")
```
