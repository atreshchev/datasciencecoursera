### Probabilities

## Comments for PosteriorProbability.png -- strength of the evidence (R^2 value)
# Note that on the right side of the figure is another column of numbers, one for each of the point estimates
# | given. This column shows posterior probabilities that relative risk is greater than 0. This, in effect, is a
# | measure of the strength of the evidence showing the correlation between pollution and hospitalization.  The
# | point here is that all of this information is located in one picture so that the reader can see the strength
# | of not only the correlations but the evidence as well.
