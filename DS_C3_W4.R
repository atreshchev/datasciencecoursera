## Assignment DS_C3_W4:
## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, 
## work with, and clean a data set.

# One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. z
# Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms 
# to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected
# from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

# The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
# You will be required to submit: 
# * a tidy data set as described below, 
# * a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
# * CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
#   or work that you performed to clean up the data. 
# * README.md in the repo with your scripts (this repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected)

# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
# 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Review criteria:
# - The submitted data set is tidy.
# - The Github repo contains the required scripts.
# - GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
# - The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
